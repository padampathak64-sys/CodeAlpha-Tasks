# CodeAlpha Internship (Jan - Feb 2026)
- Name: Padam Pathak
- Internship: CodeAlpha
- Duration: 10 January 2026 - 10 February 2026
- This repository contains all tasks completed during my codeAlpha Internship.
## Task 1- Hangman Game
### Description-
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The player tries to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of remaining attempts, and the game ends when the word is guessed correctly or attempts run out.

### Features-
- Random word selection from a predefined list.

- Player guesses one letter at a time.

- Displays current progress of the word (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n).

- Shows the number of incorrect attempts left.

- Simple text-based interface for easy interaction.

 ### Technologies used-
 - Python
 - IDE: VS Code
 - Concepts: random module, loops, conditionals, strings, lists

## Task 2- Basic Chatbot
### Description-
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through basic text input and provide predefined responses.
The chatbot continuously prompts the user for input and can handle common conversational phrases like greetings, asking about the bot’s state, or saying goodbye. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, and input/output handling, making it an excellent exercise for beginners to practice logical flow in Python.
The chatbot can be easily extended by adding more predefined inputs and responses, or by integrating additional features like small talk or keyword matching.

### Features-
- Rule-Based Responses: Responds to predefined user inputs such as "hello", "how are you", "bye".

- Interactive Loop: Keeps the conversation running until the user decides to exit.

- Function-Based Design: Uses functions to organize code and handle responses efficiently.

- Input Handling: Accepts user input through the console and evaluates it using conditional statements.

- Default Response: For unrecognized input, provides a default message such as "I didn't understand that."

- Beginner-Friendly Logic: Demonstrates key programming concepts including loops, conditional statements, and functions.

- Easily Extensible: New phrases and responses can be added without changing the main structure of the program.

### Technologies used-
- Python
- IDE: VS Code
- Concepts: input/output, if-elif-else conditions, functions

## Task 3- Stock Portfolio Tracker
### Description-
This is a stock portfolio tracker built in Python.
It allows users to calculate their total investment based on manually defined stock prices or by reading stock prices from a .txt file. Users can input stock names and quantities, and the program calculates and displays the total investment value. Optionally, investment details can be saved to a .txt file.

### Features-
- User can input stock names and quantities.

- Hardcoded stock prices dictionary (can also read from .txt file).

- Calculates investment value for each stock.

- Displays total investment on the console.

- Optional: Save investment summary to a .txt file.

- Simple and beginner-friendly Python code for learning purposes.

### Technologies used-
- Python
- IDE: VS Code
- Concepts: Dictionary (dict), Loops (while), Conditional statements (if, else), Basic arithmetic operations, Input/output (input(), print()),File handling ( write(), append())
